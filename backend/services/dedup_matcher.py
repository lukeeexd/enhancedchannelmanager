"""
Dedup matcher service — interactive stream-to-channel deduplication scorer.

Encodes ADR-008 §D2 (the hard confidence floor as a defense-in-depth
integrity constraint) for the v0.17.1 deduplication epic (bd-1v4ht). Every
confidence score the operator sees in the Pending Merges UI or via MCP
flows through ``find_candidate`` here.

ADR-008 §D2 contract (paraphrased):

    The matcher refuses to emit a candidate below ``CONFIDENCE_FLOOR``,
    regardless of the operator-configured threshold. The operator-facing
    threshold (default 80%, configurable 60-100 in Settings → Channel
    Defaults — BD-B / BD-K) can be set as low as the floor but no lower.
    Below the floor, the matcher returns "no candidate" — silent refusal,
    not an offer-merge prompt.

The floor is the load-bearing enforcement. The settings-side validator
(BD-B) is the early-rejection courtesy. Both layers read the single
``CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`` defined in the ``confidence_constants`` leaf module
so the two cannot drift; this module re-exports it for back-compat.

Normalization policy (matcher-side fallback). The matcher applies a
universal NFC + lowercase + whitespace-strip normalization to *both*
``stream_name`` and every ``candidate_name`` before scoring. The richer
per-group normalization rule (epic ratification) is BD-D's caller-side
responsibility — BD-D pre-normalizes inputs using the group's configured
rule and the matcher's universal fallback is then a no-op on
already-cased / already-stripped strings. This keeps the matcher
deterministic and self-contained: passing raw operator inputs is always
safe, the floor still holds, and callers that need richer normalization
own that step explicitly.

Scoring:

* Airing gate first — see below. A name carrying a DIFFERENT explicit
  date/time than the candidate describes a different airing, and is
  dropped before any RapidFuzz call.
* Exact match after normalization → confidence = 1.00.
* Otherwise → RapidFuzz ``fuzz.token_set_ratio(...) / 100.0``.
* Tie-break: lower ``channel_id`` wins (lexicographic on the string UUID
  — ASCII order is deterministic for Dispatcharr's UUID format).

Airing gate (schedule-driven providers). Event providers hand out a fixed
pool of slot names (``… SLOT 04``) and roll the fixture and the airing —
``@ 18 Sep 09:30 AM GMT-1`` — over every day. The slot prefix, the
tournament and the round are therefore identical in *every* name the slot
ever carries, and ``token_set_ratio`` — a subset metric — scores a
next-day fixture against yesterday's at 0.86–0.99. Queued, that stream
is deferred instead of created, and the group keeps the previous day's
channels until orphan cleanup removes them.

Stripping the date/time run is NOT the fix: with the run removed the two
names are character-for-character the same, and the pair scores 1.00 —
still queued. The date/time run is the ONE part of a schedule-driven name
that identifies which airing the name is for, so a mismatch between two
present runs is treated as a hard signal, in the same family as the M1
callsign hard-reject: different airing, not the same stream twice. The
gate fires only when BOTH sides carry a run, so ordinary names (no
date/time anywhere) score exactly as they did before.

Returns ``None`` when the candidates list is empty, when every candidate
is dropped by the airing gate, when the top-1 score falls below
``max(threshold, CONFIDENCE_FLOOR)``, or when both inputs normalize to
empty strings (defensive — RapidFuzz returns 0.0 for empty inputs, but we
short-circuit so the contract is explicit in code).

    scored_match:
        The ``ScoredMatch`` from ``score_one`` / ``score_all``.
    min_score:
        Minimum score for a ``match``-verdict pair. The caller is responsible
        for any floor clamp (the schema floors the rule path at
        ``CONFIDENCE_FLOOR``; the preview deliberately allows sub-floor
        ``min_score`` so it can SURFACE low scores — but a ``conflict`` is
        still never admissible there).
    allow_no_callsign:
        Q1 opt-in. When True, an ``absent`` pair at ``score >=
        NO_CALLSIGN_FLOOR`` becomes admissible. Default callers pass False.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True only when the pair clears the policy above.

    """The ONE shared name cleaner, parameterized by ``mode``.

    There is exactly one cleaner in the system; ``mode`` selects how
    aggressive it is. ``CONSERVATIVE`` (the default) is byte-for-byte the
    historical behavior every dedup / m3u_dedup_hook / exact caller relies
    on — the 1,341-merge incident fix pinned this and a regression test
    asserts ``_normalize(x) == _normalize(x, CONSERVATIVE)`` for the incident
    fixtures.

    CONSERVATIVE
        NFC unicode normalization → strip a leading ``N | `` channel-number
        prefix → lowercase → strip leading/trailing whitespace. The
        matcher's safety net so callers passing raw M3U-derived names still
        get a sensible score.

        The channel-number-prefix strip (lq38l.7) removes a leading
        ``<digits> | `` only — Dispatcharr prepends the channel number to the
        name (e.g. ``5 | US : ESPN 2``). The regex is anchored at the start,
        so an interior ``|`` (``HBO | East``) is preserved.

    LOCALS
        CONSERVATIVE plus the OTA/affiliate-specific steps required for the
        scored fuzzy path (enhancedchannelmanager-jnzst): (a) dotted
        sub-channel number prefix; (b) leading source/market prefixes — an
        EXPLICIT closed token set (US state codes, country codes, ``CITY``,
        ``DIREC TV``) followed by a delimiter, so network call letters like
        ``ABC:`` / ``HBO |`` are preserved (FIX 3); (c) superscript conversion
        via the reused ``convert_superscripts`` (ᴿᴬᵂ→RAW); (d) quality-tag
        stripping (RAW/UHD/HD/FHD/SD/60fps/[EVENT]); (e) run-together token
        splitting (GREENBAY→GREEN BAY). The result is lowercased, de-delimited
        and whitespace-collapsed.

    ReDoS hardening (FIX 1). The input is truncated to ``_NORMALIZE_MAX_LEN``
    before any regex runs, and LOCALS collapses whitespace to single spaces
    BEFORE the source-prefix loop so the (formerly O(n^2)) prefix regex matches
    in linear time regardless of how much whitespace an attacker pads a name
    with.

    ``None`` means "this name does not say when it airs" — a name with no

    verdict on pairs where BOTH sides state an airing.

    The key is deliberately lenient about spelling noise (case, ``.``
    after the month, ``AM`` vs ``a.m.``, leading zeros on the day and the
    hour, whitespace) and deliberately strict about everything else: two
    runs describe the same airing only when day, month, clock and zone all

    through to *create* rather than *merge* — the conservative direction,
    because creation is idempotent and a missed merge offer is
    recoverable, while a false merge offer blocks the stream behind
    operator review.

    The year is parsed only to keep it out of the clock match, and is NOT
    part of the key: one provider spelling out ``18 Sep 2026 09:30`` must
    still compare equal to another's ``18 Sep 09:30``. A pair differing

    ----------
    stream_name:
        Raw incoming stream name (e.g. from an M3U entry or a drag-drop
        payload). Will be normalized internally; pass as-stored.
    candidates:
        List of ``(channel_id, channel_name)`` tuples representing the
        existing channels in the target group's scope. Channel IDs are
        Dispatcharr UUIDs (strings).
    threshold:
        Operator-configured minimum confidence in [0.0, 1.0]. **Clamped
        to ``CONFIDENCE_FLOOR``** before any RapidFuzz call — a request
        for a 0.30 threshold gets 0.60 behavior. The clamp is the

    RapidFuzz. The exact-match path is unconditional — it does not
    inspect ``threshold`` — because an exact match is the strongest
    possible signal and any operator-configured threshold is, by
    definition, below 1.00.
