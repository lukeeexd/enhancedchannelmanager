"""
Bulk M3U import dedup hook — populates the ``pending_merges`` queue
when the auto-creation pipeline (triggered by M3U refresh) is about
to create a new channel that fuzzy-matches an existing channel in
the same target group.

Encodes ADR-008 §D1 (bulk M3U is one of the four interactive trigger
surfaces), §D5 (partial unique index on ``(stream_name,
candidate_channel_id) WHERE status='pending'``), and §D9 (rows in
``pending_merges`` ARE the queue — no broker, write directly).

The hook fires AFTER the auto-creation executor's existing
exact/normalized lookups (``_find_channel_by_name``) have failed
and BEFORE the new-channel ``create_channel`` API call. When a
fuzzy candidate is found above the operator-configured threshold
(clamped to the §D2 confidence floor by the matcher itself), the
hook:

* INSERTs a ``pending_merges`` row with ``status='pending'`` and
  ``trigger_context='m3u_refresh'``.
* Increments the ``ecm_pending_merges_queue_depth_added_total``
  counter (LOCKED CONTRACT per BD-M).
* Signals the caller to SKIP the channel-creation step. The pending
  row encodes the deferred operator decision.

When the matcher returns no candidate, the hook is a no-op and the
auto-creation pipeline proceeds with normal channel creation.

When the same ``(stream_name, candidate_channel_id)`` pair is
re-enqueued (e.g. an M3U refresh repeats a stream the operator has
not yet resolved), the §D5 partial unique index raises
``IntegrityError`` at INSERT time. The hook catches this, logs at
INFO, and returns the same "skip channel creation" signal — the
prior pending row is still authoritative.

Dry-run handling: the hook is bypassed when ``dry_run=True``. A
preview must not mutate the queue. The auto-creation executor's
own dry-run branch handles the simulated-channel bookkeeping; the
hook simply returns ``DedupHookResult(enqueued=False)`` so the
preview shows the would-create action verbatim.

        either freshly inserted by this invocation, or already present

        deferred decision.

        False when no candidate was found, when dedup was disabled at

        ``None`` for the collision branch (we did not re-score the
        existing pending row) and for the no-enqueue branches.
    merge_id:
        The ``pending_merges`` row id the caller is now blocked behind —
        the row this call inserted, or the pre-existing pending row it
        collided with (§D5). ``None`` when ``enqueued`` is False.

        GH #1015: a deferred stream is invisible in the run summary
        otherwise ("0 channels created" reads the same as "the provider
        had nothing"), and the operator needs the row id to resolve the
        block. Set on BOTH branches, so the collision path — the one that

    Encodes the load-bearing ADR-008 invariants in one place so the two

    * §D5 idempotency — the partial unique index
      ``(stream_name, candidate_channel_id) WHERE status='pending'``
      raises ``IntegrityError`` on a duplicate pending row. This is
      caught, the existing row is looked up, and its ``merge_id`` is
      returned (``fresh=False``). No second journal row, no metric bump.
    * §D6 audit — EVERY fresh enqueue writes a ``pending_merge_journal``
      row with ``action_type='auto_queued'`` and the full seven-field
      audit set. ``source_channel_id`` is the raw ``stream_name`` (the
      bulk-import / queue-time audit-first fallback per §D6 — the
      Dispatcharr stream id is not resolved at queue time). ``confidence_
      score`` is the score captured at action time (``match.confidence``).
    * BD-M metric — a fresh insert increments
      ``ecm_pending_merges_queue_depth_added_total`` (LOCKED CONTRACT)
      and refreshes the companion queue-depth gauge.

    The row INSERT + journal write land in a single ``commit`` so a
    crash between them cannot leave a queue row with no audit trail.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stream_name:
        Raw incoming stream name (stored verbatim; normalization is the
        matcher's compare-time concern).
    group_id:
        Dispatcharr group id, or ``None`` for the ungrouped scope
        (stored as NULL).
    match:
        The already-scored :class:`MatchResult`. The caller runs the
        matcher; this core trusts the candidate id + confidence verbatim
        (the caller is responsible for using the authoritative
        action-time threshold, per §D6).
    trigger_context:
        ``'m3u_refresh'`` | ``'add_stream'`` | ``'drag_drop'`` |
        ``'mcp_tool'`` — the surface that enqueued the row. Written to
        both ``pending_merges.trigger_context`` and the journal row.
    actor_token_id:
        The §D6 audit actor — the token's DB id as a string, or
        ``"anonymous"`` when auth is disabled. For the M3U hook this is
        a fixed system-actor sentinel; for the MCP path it is resolved
        from the bearer token.
    db_session:
        SQLAlchemy session for ECM's ``journal.db``. The core commits
        its own unit of work and rolls back on the §D5 collision so the
        caller can keep using the session.

    ----------
    stream_name:
        Raw incoming stream name (the M3U-delivered name; normalization
        is the matcher's compare-time concern, not stored).
    group_id:
        Dispatcharr group id for the target channel scope. ``None``
        means ungrouped — stored as NULL in ``pending_merges.group_id``.
    candidates:
        ``(channel_id, channel_name)`` tuples for existing channels in
        the same target group. ``channel_id`` may be int or str; it is
        stringified before scoring (the matcher accepts str) and before
        insertion (``candidate_channel_id`` is TEXT per ADR-008 §D8).
        Caller is responsible for the group-scope filter — the hook
        does not re-fetch.
    threshold:
        Operator-configured confidence threshold (typically
        ``settings.dedup_threshold``). The matcher clamps to
        ``CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`` before scoring (ADR-008 §D2 load-bearing
        enforcement) — passing a below-floor value still gets floor
        behaviour.
    triggered_by:
        Engine-side ``triggered_by`` string. Only ``"m3u_refresh"``
        activates the hook; other values short-circuit with
        ``DedupHookResult(enqueued=False)`` so the auto-creation
        pipeline's scheduled / manual paths are untouched.
    dry_run:
        When True, the hook short-circuits without writing or scoring.
        A dry-run preview must not mutate the queue.
    db_session:
        SQLAlchemy session for the ECM ``journal.db``. The hook
        commits its own INSERT (single-row write) and rolls back on
        IntegrityError so the caller can keep using the session.
